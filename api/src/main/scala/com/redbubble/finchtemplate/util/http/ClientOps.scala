    * - We set some sensible (think so?) defaults for the nummber of connections, and waiters.
    * - Knowing that we'll have users on the end of a connection, and given we are server->server, we set
    * some low thresholds on acquisition and total request times. We assume the retries take care of intermittent
    * load on these downstream services.
    * - We up the TCP connection timeout to 2 seconds, to cater for a delay in acquiring connections to the monolith
    * (but leave the total acquisition time at higher, as this includes acquiring a session).
